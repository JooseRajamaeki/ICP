This solution provides a python module _icp_matcher.pyd which can be used to incrementally match two data sets.

You need to set up a few things before using it:
1) Create environment variable PYTHON_PATH that directs to your Python installation (Something like C:\Users\UserName\Program Files\Python\Python36)
2) Create environment variable PYTHON_INCLUDE which points to the Python path's include folder.
3) The project assumes that PYTHON_PATH folder has folder "libs", which contains the Python libraries.
4) Install Swig and add it to the PATH.

Compiling the library:
1) Open the solution (sln-file)
2) Right-click "icp_matcher.i" and select "Compile"
3) Autogenerated file "icp_matcher_wrap.cxx" is produced. You might need to reload it to the editor.
4) Right-click the project "icp_matcher" and select "Build"

Notice that the build only works in "Release" mode and build target (32-bit or 64-bit) should match your version of Python.

Setting up the Visual Studio project was quite a hassle. http://www.voidcn.com/article/p-acjikmhz-wz.html had good detailed instructions on getting it to work. If you encounter errors, you might want to check it.
