The codes in this repository implement algorithms described in the paper "An Iterative Closest Points Approach to Neural Generative Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06562). The algorithms train neural networks to learn mappings between distributions.

The folder "PythonModule" contains a Visual Studio solution to build a Python module that can be used to perform the matching, which is described in the paper. The example in the folder "SmallTensorflowExample" illustrates the use of the module.
